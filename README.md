![Logo](https://github.com/RomeroCode/QualityTool/blob/main/DQAT.png)

## Overview

The "Data Quality Assurance Tool" project is a comprehensive solution for data quality management and control in Internet of Things (IoT) environments. Specifically designed for applications like aquaculture, this repository introduces an event-driven software architecture, leveraging the Python programming language.

## Key Features

1. **Event-Driven Architecture:** The repository implements an event-driven architecture to handle real-time data collection, processing, and analysis generated by IoT sensors.

2. **Modular Layers:** Organized into distinct modules, the project includes components for event generation (producers), event processing (processors), and event consumption (consumers).

3. **Efficient Persistence:** The persistence layer uses a dedicated database to store events and quality metrics, ensuring durability and query capability.

4. **Flexible Integration:** Integration modules allow seamless connection with other systems and services, featuring adapters for external APIs and connectors for databases.

5. **Robust Security:** It includes authentication and authorization features to ensure system security, controlling access to data and events.

6. **Monitoring and Logs:** A monitoring layer provides tools to trace event flow, analyze system performance, and log information for auditing.

7. **Centralized Configuration:** A configuration module enables easy adjustment of project settings to meet specific environment needs.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Kafka broker running (localhost:9092)

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle: [Sensor-Based Aquaponics Fish Pond Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ogbuokiriblessing/sensor-based-aquaponics-fish-pond-datasets).

### Dataset Structure
The dataset includes sensor readings for parameters such as temperature, turbidity, ammonia, nitrate, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and geographic coordinates. The data is stored in a CSV file located at `QualityTool/data/sensor_readings.csv`.

## Academic Origin

This project was created during the Master's program in Information Engineering at the Federal University of ABC (UFABC). It represents a culmination of academic research and practical implementation, addressing challenges in data quality management within IoT environments.
